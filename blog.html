        <h2>Learning html and css</h2>

        <p>I thought this would be a little easier than it is. It's definitely a bit challenging, but I'm learning a lot about HTML and all the elements that go into creating a website. I can't wait to fully build something on my own from scratch</p>

        <h2>Learning about media queries</h2>
        <p>When I was starting out in FSDI Session 102, I thought I was doing something completely wrong because my site didn't look the way it was supposed to. But then I learned about media queries, which make the site responsive to whatever device you're on.</p>
